        <h1 class="head">LPU - GREEN UNIVERSITY</h1><br> The dependency of electricity generation using coal-based power plants is in practice. A concentrated effort to expand capacity in the field of clean and inexpensive energy is necessary to make the transition from the current fossil fuel-based energy system to the renewable energy-based systems of the future. The harnessing and use of solar energy is playing an important role to achieve this task worldwide. India faces twin challenges to fulfill energy demand of its population keeping in mind global efforts to mitigate climate change. However, as pointed out in a report titled Energy Statistics 2020 by Ministry of Statistics and Plan Implementation, Government of India, “India has expanded its renewable source of electricity generation capacity by 8.51% over a year which has led to downward trend in the cost and has increased usage”. Interestingly, according to The Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index (RECAI) 2022, Indian renewable energy sector is the third most attractive renewable energy market in the world. The shift from a fossil-fuel-based energy system to future renewable-energy-based systems necessitates a determined effort in the field of clean and inexpensive energy capacity building. Solar power and wind power potential in India are estimated to be in the magnitude of 7,48,990 MW and 6,95,509 MW, respectively. The Indian government has set a goal of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Fossil fuels dominated the twentieth century, with the twenty-first century serving as an era of transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. To solve the problems of growing energy resources and reducing carbon dioxide emissions, a wide range of energy issues and creative technologies are required. Lovely Professional University (LPU) is likewise moving in the same path as the Government of India’s ambition.

LPU is committed to clean energy deployment, academic programmes, research, professional training, and consulting in the areas of renewable energy, energy-efficient buildings, energy conservation, and sustainability management. The university has a 5.1 MW solar power plant and an energy performance index of 33.42 kWh/m2/year. The consumption is much lower than a 5-star rated building as per Bureau of Energy Efficiency, Government of India <br>

<br><b>ACADEMIC INITIATIVES</b><br>

<br>
<ol>
    <li>Energy consumption in India is expanding at a rate of 7 to 10% each year, owing to the country’s growing economy. It is commonly understood that carbon-based fossil fuels contribute to global warming. As a result, it is critical to develop new and effective sustainable energy methods.
     To meet such demands, the development of the necessary skill-sets need to be cultivated and developed.</li>

<li>Through research, teaching, operational practices, and capacity building, Lovely Professional University is dedicated to resource conservation and sustainability. As a result, 115 courses for undergraduate, postgraduate, and research studies programmes have been embedded by the university. More than 8000 students are the beneficiary of these courses/programs.</li>
 <li>The prime objective for the designed courses is to build up the understanding for clean and affordable energy and to help the nation and globally to meet the future requirements of United Nations development goals. A few major courses of the University are Solar energy technology, Renewable energy and green technology, Renewable Energy, Wind and solar energy systems, Workshop and design of solar systems, Energy conservation for electrical engineering, Non-conventional energy resources, Non-conventional energy sources and energy auditing, Energy Conservation, New and Emerging Technologies, Energy-efficient Building Design Strategies; Sustainable Development and the Livelihood, and Clean Fuel etc. Students also worked on 14 Capstone projects related to energy for the year 2020-2021.

<li>The courses on green economy and sustainability namely ‘Renewable Energy Systems’, ‘Sustainability Ecology and Landscape’ and ‘Sustainability and Energy Efficiency’ have been incorporated in the curriculum of undergraduate programs wherein live project is an integral component of these courses respectively. School of Bioengineering and Biosciences has created an interdisciplinary team of UG & PG students working on green economy aiming sustainability development by extracting the value products from lignocellulosic waste and evaluating their potential in various applications such as antimicrobials. Further, the enzyme study to degrade the lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production is also in progress.</li>

<li>Lovely Professional University is committed to increased use of clean energy sources and is already undertaking various small-scale sustainable power projects and promoting green energy heavily.</li>

<li>Lovely Professional University is devoted to increasing the usage of clean energy sources and is now working on a number of small-scale sustainable power projects as well as extensively promoting green energy.</li> <br>
</ol>
 


<br><u>Solar Power Plant</u>: The University’s commitment to guidelines contributes to the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, and it’s worth noting that in 2018, the University erected a 1.1 MW rooftop solar PV plant. In the year 2021, total solar electricity generation is expected to be 1.39 million kWh, saving 1271 tonnes of CO2. Not only has the university lowered the total power use by 15941400 kWh (reduced by 74.15%), but it has also boosted the university’s renewable generation by 97074 kWh (increased by 7.49%), while the university’s conventional energy consumption has decreased by 15844325.8 kWh (reduced by 73.71%). Currently, 5.1 MW of solar power plants have been installed in University

<br><u>Energy Efficient Building</u>: In an era of smart cities, sustainable buildings and contemporary interiors, University designed an energy-efficient building with specialized architects. They have also trained our students to become lateral thinkers by focusing on the critical design approach. With exposure to an international environment, access to the latest tools, software’s and technology, our students also become architects that create buildings and infrastructure that are globally acknowledged. Due to the incorporation of energy-efficient building strategies, the energy consumption density of the LPU buildings is much lower than a 5-star rated building by Bureau of Energy Efficiency, Government of India.

<br><u>Green transportation</u>: Solar power bus and battery-operated e-rickshaw in the campus are operating since 2017. 22 e-rickshaws service connecting its major buildings, departments, hostels for students and faculty members. Nearly 100 Km mileage is giving by each e-rickshaw. In this way, the university strives to combat the detrimental carbon-emitting conventional fuel vehicles and helping towards the improvement of air quality at the micro-level.

<br><u>Solar Irrigation System</u>: The University installed three solar-powered irrigation systems and also used in lawns , gardens for watering the plants. Each unit has a five- horsepower capacity. These motors are used in drip irrigation systems to irrigate orchards. This system is extremely efficient in terms of reducing water loss and making efficient use of energy and water resources.

<br><u>Biogas plant</u>: Organic waste can be collected and used to make biogas, a renewable source of energy, to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and the danger of pollution to rivers. Biogas is made up of about 50% to 70% methane, 30% to 40% carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases In this regard, the University has three 3-cubic-meter biogas systems in operation across campus which processes and treats kitchen waste.

<br><u>Centralized Chiller Plant</u>: The University replaced split and window air conditioners in administrative buildings with a 265 TR centralized chiller water-based cooling system. When compared to conventional air conditioners, the new system uses 40% less electricity. The university has a strategy for lowering energy usage by scheduling the running duration of air conditioning devices during the day and during peak summer months.
